Compiling
---------
To compile you need [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/). Do apt-get install rake.

Run command rake test to compile program and start tests. If a problem due to an exsting tmp-folder, remove it and try again. 

Grammar notes
-------------
The grammar has one shift-reduce problem; the dangling else problem.

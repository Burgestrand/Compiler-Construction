> An explanation of how the compiler is used (what options, what output, etc)

The compiler has no options, apart from the file to be compiled. Invoking
“jlc” without any arguments (or invalid arguments) will show usage help:

  Usage: jlc path/to/javalette/source.jl

When invoked, it will compile the given file and place output in the same
directory as the original file is located in in the form of a .class file.

– A speciﬁcation of the Javalette language (if produced by BNF converter, you
may just refer to your BNFC source ﬁle).

See `src/javalette/javalette.cf` for grammar file.

– A list of shift/reduce conﬁcts in your parser, if you have such conﬂicts,
and an analysis of them.

The grammar has one shift-reduce problem; the dangling else problem.

– If applicable, a list of features not implemented and the reason why.

This submission is partial, and will be rejected automatically as it does
not pass the grading tests. The reason is that we time optimists and not
very good at managing our time (yet).
